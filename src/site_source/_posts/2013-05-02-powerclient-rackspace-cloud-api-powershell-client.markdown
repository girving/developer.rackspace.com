##Who am I and why should you use this client?

My name is Mitch Robins and I am currently a sales engineer in the SMB segement for Rackspace. Having 15+ years in the IT trenches with Windows (from desktop support to solutions architecture), this was the perfect opportunity to be able to contribute to the Windows community to help with cloud management and adoption. The idea for this client was born out of just that notion. There was a need for a Windows native API client, and we were in a good position to create something to enable the community at large could use. Over the last few months, we've spent quite a bit of personal and Rackspace sponsored time in getting this tool developed to specifically fill this gap and make life easier for Windows users.<!-- more -->

##What is PowerClient?

For Rackspace Cloud and Openstack deployments, there is a fantastic CLI called `python-novaclient`. It's Python based and works natively within just about any Linux distribution you can think of, and can even be adapted to work in Windows. However, if you're a systems administrator or work in IT operations as an "uptime czar" like me, you know just how convoluted the process can be of implementing native Linux tools within Windows. That type of setup just doesn't fly for managing a PRODUCTION deployment. You want to be able to use natively supported and functional tools, without the potential headache of having something fail because it wasn't meant for use within the Windows eco-system. Enter PowerClient.

PowerClient is a Powershell based API client for Rackspace’s public cloud environment. It is setup to work with Rackspace’s “Next Gen” servers, powered by Openstack. The roadmap of this client is to port it for use with ANY Openstack environment, however, no timeframe has been established on this milestone yet.

This Powershell module utilizes standard function definitions, and can be added to as needed, if you want to enable your own custom cmdlets (please contribute as you see fit!). Here is an example of one entire cmdlet, including its help documentation:

```powershell
function Get-CloudServerImages {

    Param(
        [Parameter (Position=1, Mandatory=$true)]
        [string] $Region
    )

    ## Setting variables needed to execute this function
    Set-Variable -Name DFWImageURI -Value "https://dfw.servers.api.rackspacecloud.com/v2/$CloudDDI/images/detail.xml"
    Set-Variable -Name ORDImageURI -Value "https://ord.servers.api.rackspacecloud.com/v2/$CloudDDI/images/detail.xml"

## Using conditional logic to route requests to the relevant API per data center
if ($Region -eq "DFW"){

    ## Authentication token check/retrieval
    Get-AuthToken

    ## Making the call to the API for a list of available server images and storing data into a variable
    [xml]$ServerImageListDFWStep0 = (Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $DFWImageURI  -Headers $HeaderDictionary)
    [xml]$ServerImageListDFWFinal = ($ServerImageListDFWStep0.innerxml)

    ## Since the response body is XML, we can use dot notation to show the information needed without further parsing.
    $ServerImageListDFWFinal.Images.Image | Sort-Object Name | ft $ImageListTable -AutoSize
    }

## See first "if" block for notes on each line##
elseif ($Region -eq "ORD"){

    Get-AuthToken

    [xml]$ServerImageListORDStep0 = (Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $ORDImageURI  -Headers $HeaderDictionary)
    [xml]$ServerImageListORDFinal = ($ServerImageListORDStep0.innerxml)

    $ServerImageListORDFinal.Images.Image | Sort-Object Name | ft $ImageListTable -AutoSize
    }

else {

    ## Sending a text error if the region has been misspelled
    Send-RegionError
    }

 .SYNOPSIS
 The Get-CloudServerImages cmdlet will pull down a list of all Rackspace Cloud Server image snapshots on your account, including Rackspace's base OS images.

 .DESCRIPTION
 See the synopsis field.

 .PARAMETER Region
 Use this parameter to indicate the region in which you would like to execute this request.  Valid choices are "DFW" or "ORD" (without the quotes).

  .EXAMPLE
 PS C:\Users\Administrator> Get-CloudServerImages -Region DFW
 This example shows how to get a list of all available images in your account within the DFW region.

  .EXAMPLE
 PS C:\Users\Administrator> Get-CloudServerImages ORD
 This example shows how to get a list of all available images in your account within the ORD region, but without specifying the parameter name itself.  Both examples work interchangably. Example output:


 PS C:\Users\mitch.robins> Get-CloudServerImages ord

```

As with any 3rd party script/module, please use this module at your own risk, even though I have tested it against my own personal account many times.

##Are there any prerequisites I need to run PowerClient?

There are a few requirements to make sure that PowerClient runs smoothly for you on the PC/server of your choice:

**Rackspace Cloud Account**

* Username
* DDI (account number)
* API Key

**.NET & Windows Management Framework 3.0, respectively**

* [Download .NET Here](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=17851)
* [Download WMF 3.0 Here](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=34595)
	
**Powershell Execution Policy**

This script is not yet signed. In order for this module to be properly imported, please run "Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted" as a local/domain admin on your server. **Please note, if you have UAC enabled, you must run Powershell "as an administrator" to be able to manipulate execution policy.**

##How does PowerClient get installed?

The way this script is built is as a Powershell module. Start by downloading as a ZIP file [HERE](https://github.com/drmmarsunited/rackspacecloud_powershell/archive/master.zip). By default, PowerShell looks in the paths specified in the $env:PSModulePath environment variable when searching for available modules on a system. This contains two paths out of the box

1. System Location - `%windir%\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\Modules`

2. Currently logged on user location - `%UserProfile%\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Modules`

For the sake of ease, place the "PowerClient" folder in the 2nd listed folder above. Once you’ve placed the folder in its new location, edit the “RSCloud.psm1” with Notepad (or you’re preferred text editor). In this file, the following lines need to be edited with you Rackspace cloud account information (place your information between the double quotes):

```powershell
## Define Global Variables Needed for API Comms ##

Set-Variable -Name CloudUsername -Value "" -Scope Global
Set-Variable -Name CloudAPIKey -Value "" -Scope Global
Set-Variable -Name CloudDDI -Value "" -Scope Global
## *The CloudDDI variable is your account number or tenant ID.  This can be found at the top right of your screen when logged into the Rackspace Cloud Control Panel*
```

After editing the file, please save it! You can then launch Powershell, and run `Import-Module PowerClient`. At this point, you should be able to run all the commands listed in the wiki (link below) at your leisure. 

##Are there any other sources for information or tips for PowerClient?

Help for individual commands are built into the module and can be viewed by using normal Powershell cmdlets, for example `Get-Help Get-CloudServers`. To get more information, I will be maintaining a small wiki with supported command overviews, future work plans, and more help. It can be found here:

<https://github.com/drmmarsunited/rackspacecloud_powershell/wiki>

##Pro tips!

* Maximize your window and screen buffer sizes to get the most output possible in your Powershell window.
* Towards the top of the module, every command has an alias that is commented out. You can uncomment these lines to make using this module even easier for yourself and other administrators.
